* Current Status: PASSED all tests. 
  * Project #1-Buffer Pool Manager: Full score. Implement in a naive way first. Optimized using cache pool(std::list + std::unordered_set).
  * Project #2-B+ Tree: Full score. Algorithm implementation is guided by the course text book pseudo code description. Concurrency control is optimized using optimistic locking protocol.
  * Project #3-Query Execution: Full score. P4 concurrency control is taken into implementation in DeleteExecutor,SeqScanExecutor&InsertExecutor. Optimization is partially finished: partial optimization for leaderboard#1,leaderboard#2. Full optimization is made to leaderboard#3 which is good enough.
