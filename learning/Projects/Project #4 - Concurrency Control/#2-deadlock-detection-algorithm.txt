Deadlock Detection Algorithm

Basic idea:
new class: node, edge, graph.
Graph: ordered_map(node) nodes_;
Node: ordered_map<Node> tails_;

for each detection, we traverse the map from the txn with the min txn id to the one with max txn id in order.

Note: youngest txn is the txn which has the min txn_id.
